# Tales of a Clock Maker

![Clock in Processing](clock_processing.png "Clock in Processing")

I programmed some analog clocks. It might not sound very impressive, but
somehow, it turned out that this was actually a good use of my time!

This is kind of going to be another one of my ungodly long rants about
things that *should* be easy, but which are actually deceptively
complicated. For another one of those, I recommend reading my tiny
short ramble about
[importing photos from SD cards][photoflow_importinator_history].

## Why would anyone make an analog clock, anyway?

Good question! And it will be answered more fully on this
very page *very soon.*
