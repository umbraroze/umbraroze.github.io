Welcome! This site is currently pretty bare-bones, but I will eventually put here
some stuff about the more interesting recent software development adventures.

  A dictionary app for constructed language enthusiasts.
  Also a massive C# desktop development learning exercise.

## Upcoming

- Processing hacks, including:
  - Visualisation stuff
  - A weird music insturment control thingie
- Janky hardware jank-hacks with Raspberry Pi
- Some retro projects with Turbo Pascal 'n' stuff
- Old Stuff that *might not be* as good as I remember it was
