Welcome to my new blog!

I'm trying to find a solution to the fact that I have the need to write
blog posts, but I'm somehow not actually finishing the posts and even
more importantly I don't even know where to post them. I currently
have a [Mastodon account](https://tech.lgbt/@umbraroze) which I use
for microbloggy stuff and Tumblr for random stuff that's bigger than
that, but I want to get back to writing some blog posts that are
*themed* and *topical* and stuff.

So, because GitHub graciously offers people web space through a web dev
tool I'm already pretty familiar with -- that is to say, Jekyll -- I guess
I'll set up my programming and software development related blog here.
This will probably cover stuff that I'm doing in both
[GitHub](https://github.com/umbraroze) and
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/umbraroze).

Now, all I need to do is to make sure that this won't be the last sad
post in the feed and all you end up seeing is "Welcome to the Blog!" in
the feed. It has happened. ADHD brain, see?
